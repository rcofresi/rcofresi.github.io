Preclinical neuroscientist focused on the role of Pavlovian and operant conditioning in problematic alcohol use and concerned with the gap in translation of findings from non-human animal models into humans. Now trying to help bridge that gap.

I received my <b>B.Sc. Biochemistry</b> in 2013 and my <b>Phd in Neuroscience</b> from <a href="https://neuroscience.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a> in 2018. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, in the <a href="https://psychology.missouri.edu/"> Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri</a>. Selected ongoing projects include:
• Longitudinal human alcohol cue reactivity study. University of Missouri. NIAAA R01-AA-025451. PI: Bruce D. Bartholow, Thomas M. Piasecki.
• Second-order Pavlovian conditioning to alcohol cues in humans. University of Missouri. PI: Roberto U. Cofresí, Bruce D. Bartholow.

I use GitHub/this page to host some of my research output. Feel free to message me for my CV, or any research-related question.
